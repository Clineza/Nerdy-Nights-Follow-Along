# Clineza's Nerdy Nights Follow Along with ca65
This follow along is not a demonstration but is instead a way to show my work and progress with NES 6502 Development.

## Clineza's Introduction
Hi I am Clineza! My reasoning for making my own repository for Nerdy Nights, is so that I can show off what I made so you can feel encouraged to do the same. The modern world is full of abstraction and complex engines. I wanted to take a step back to relive the old days; The days that I quite frankly never got to live myself. I am young enough, and quite fortunate enough, to have grown up in a time where handheld flip phones, fast computers, and stunning games have already been created. I am of course talking about mid 2000s till mid 2010s. Anytime before then, I was either too young to remember or not even born yet.

I perhaps might be a bit of an outlier in wanting to code games for the NES considering I didn't grow up during the time when the 6502 thrived. However, I can't help is considering how fascinating hardware and low level software really is. I went to school for Web Development and got to learn a lot about JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and PHP. Learning anything new does excite me but I always felt like I needed more. I wanted to truly learn how computers actually worked! What are transistors? What is binary? How is data stored in microscopic tiny pieces of metal. And more importantly, how can I program all of that?

The 6502 processor felt like the perfect weapon for learning all of these kinds of technologies. Firstly, it was popular back in the day, and still is for hobbiests. Secondly, it has a quite simple 56 instruction set with 16 bit address and 8 bit data bus. I felt like these limitations and simplicity would be perfect for teaching me computers. 

Now the 6502 is no slouch! Variations that come from this processor were used on plenty of popular machines back in the day. Atari 2600, Commodore 64, the infamous Apple II, and of course the NES! There are plenty more machines developed of course but these are some quite notable ones.

Prior to this venture, I was learning how to make games with more modern technologies such as, Lua with Love2D, Golang with Ebiten, or even using a full engine like Godot. The plan was to remake some of my favorite games from Club Penguin with my own pixel art and retro aesthetic. So what better "engine" to use is no engine at all, but instead make it to be ran on the NES!!! That is what leads me here today with making my own walk through the Nerdy Nights Series! 

## Nerdy Nights Overview
Nerdy Nights is a tutorial series to help people write games for the NES. It introduces the concepts in a user-friendly way, and for years has been the go-to solution for many people to learn NES programming. It was originally written by Brian Parker (aka BunnyBoy), with some additional audio tutorals written by MetalSlime.
